# Overview of the Study
By Joseph Castle, PhD, Code.gov [^fn1]

*This write-up elaborates portions of the [Federal Source Code Study (FSCS)](#), a three-year study conducted from 2017 to 2020 by the Code.gov team to better understand agency implementation of the Federal Source Code Policy (FSCP). The study considered open source software (OSS) publication as one indicator of FSCP implementation and examined why some agencies publish OSS and others do not.*

## Towards a Federal Source Code Policy (FSCP)

The federal government spends approximately six billion dollars on software each year[^fn3], representing 7% of the [information technology (IT) budget](https://itdashboard.gov/) of the [Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Financial_Officers_Act). [^fn4]

This purchasing of software frequently results in duplicative and wasteful spending annually because the software is not publicly shared. Agencies purchase software and customize as needed, often leading to software purchasing and support that is costly, allows for little to no reuse, results in duplication of effort and spending across agencies, and overall yields poor quality. [^fn5][^fn6]

In 2016, as a response to inefficiencies with software purchasing and reuse, the White House issued the [Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software]((https://sourcecode.cio.gov/)) or the FSCP. 

The FSCP directed CFO Act agencies to do three things: 
1. Create an agency source code policy; 
2. Update acquisition language to capture new custom code; and, 
3. Create a source code inventory and publish at least 20% as open source software (OSS). 

The FSCP also established the Code.gov program and technical platform of a [website](https://code.gov/) and [application programming interface (API)](https://open.gsa.gov/api/codedotgov/).

## Organizational Factors Affecting OSS Publishing

Along with the FSCP, the Code.gov team wondered why some agencies could publish OSS and other agencies could not. This stemmed from assumptions about agency IT budgets and technical capabilities. Conceivably, every agency has the following characteristics to support OSS publication.

- An inherent mandate to serve the public by being transparent and release public funded products (when appropriate with considering security, privacy, and like factors).
- A mandate to comply with the FSCP and publish OSS.
- An IT budget with a portion devoted to software development.
- IT specialists and contractors with technical skills who regularly work with software.

Since some agencies were not publishing OSS and arguably with implementation of the FSCP, this signaled potentially  systemic organizational factors related to organizational cultural beliefs, public engagement, structural dimension, and organizationl location.




## Study Participants

Data was collected from GitHub’s application programming interface (API) and created a list of 23 of 24 executive-level agencies that published OSS both before and after the FSCP was issued. From these agencies, 25 participants from 20 agencies agreed to participate in the study.

The sample consisted of participants from units mostly located outside a Chief Information Officer (CIO) office that focused on software development and data science activities.

## Significance of the Study

The U.S. federal government has over 6,800 software projects listed on the Code.gov website with 80% being open source software (OSS) (“Sharing America’s Code,” n.d.). These software projects are reused at varying rates, resulting in software development efficiencies and cost savings to the user.

Commonly reused software project examples include GSA's [U.S. Web Design Standard](#), LLNL's [Zettabyte File System (ZFS)](#), EPA's [Water Network Tool for Resilience (WNTR)](#), and NSA's [WALKOFF](#).
