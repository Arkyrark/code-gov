# Overview of the Study
By Joseph Castle, PhD, Code.gov [^fn1]

*This write-up elaborates portions of the [Federal Source Code Study (FSCS)](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/), a three-year study conducted from 2017 to 2020 by the Code.gov team to better understand agency implementation of the Federal Source Code Policy (FSCP). The study considered open source software (OSS) publication as one indicator of FSCP implementation and examined why some agencies publish OSS and others do not.*

> Computer software (SW) is essential for the daily operations of industry and government. “More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software – from movies to agriculture to national defense”. [^fn2]

## Towards a Federal Source Code Policy (FSCP)

The federal government spends approximately six billion dollars on SW each year[^fn3], representing 7% of the [information technology (IT) budget](https://itdashboard.gov/) of the [Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Financial_Officers_Act). [^fn4]

This purchasing of SW frequently results in duplicative and wasteful spending annually because the SW is not publicly shared. Agencies purchase SW and customize as needed, often leading to SW purchasing and support that is costly, allows for little to no reuse, results in duplication of effort and spending across agencies, and overall yields poor quality. [^fn5][^fn6]

In 2016, as a response to inefficiencies with software purchasing and reuse, the White House issued the [Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software]((https://sourcecode.cio.gov/)) or the FSCP. 

The FSCP directed CFO Act agencies to do three things: 
1. Create an agency source code policy; 
2. Update acquisition language to capture new custom code; and, 
3. Create a source code inventory and publish at least 20% as open source software (OSS). 

The FSCP also established the Code.gov program and technical platform of a [website](https://code.gov/) and [application programming interface (API)](https://open.gsa.gov/api/codedotgov/).

## Organizational Factors Affecting OSS Publication

The [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) provided metadata about agencies publishing OSS with mixed results. The Code.gov team wondered why some agencies could publish OSS and other agencies could not. Conceivably, every agency has the following characteristics to support OSS publication.

- An inherent mandate to serve the public by being transparent and release public funded products (as appropriate with consideration to security, privacy, etc.).
- FSCP enforcing compliance to publish OSS.
- An IT budget with a portion devoted to SW development.
- IT specialists and contractors with technical skills who regularly work with SW.

The mandate, capability and budget was consistent across agencies, the premise of the study centered on potential systemic organizational factors related to organizational cultural beliefs, public engagement, structural dimension, and organization location that may influence agency OSS publication.

## Study Description

The qualitative study included a metadata analysis, interviews, and artifact collection (e.g., SOPs, organization charts). The sample contained the following attributes.

- 20 of 24 CFO Act agencies were represented.
- 25 participants were from unique SW development units. There were multiple participants from some agencies, but no participant from the same SW development unit.
- Unit functions mostly included SW development and data science.
- Units often consumed more OSS than they published.
- More units were located outside the agency Chief Information Officer (CIO) office. (Note: The CIO is the the primary audience of the FSCP but more SW development was happening outside the CIO office.)

## Significance of the Study

U.S. federal government agencies have been consuming OSS for the past 70 years but are new to publishing their own source code. Agency OSS publication is a unique policy output and a tangible indicator of effective policy implementation.

This study is significant for public administrators as it provides a glimpse of organizational factors agencies need to consider to implement policy and technology.

## Coming Up

The next part of this series dives into the history of OSS including how the U.S. government played a large role in the early days of computer dating to WWII. It discusses how OSS began as a normal part of computing, to be shunned by for-profit companies, and then to make a more recent comeback.
