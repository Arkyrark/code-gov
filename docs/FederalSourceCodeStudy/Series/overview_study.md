# Overview of the Study
By Joseph Castle, PhD, Code.gov*

*This file elaborates on portions of the [Federal Source Code Study (FSCS)](#), a three-year study conducted from 2017 to 2020 by the Code.gov team to better understand agency implementation of the Federal Source Code Policy (FSCP). The study considered OSS publication as one indicator of FSCP implementation. The study provided examined why some agencies publish OSS and others do not.*

Computer software is essential for the daily operations of industry and government. “More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software – from movies to agriculture to national defense” (Andreessen, 2011, p. 1).

## Federal Software Difficulties

The federal government spends approximately six billion dollars on software each year (Johnson & Sears, 2017), representing 7% of the information technology (IT) budget of the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies (“Government-wide Information Technology Agency Summary,” 2017).

This purchasing of software frequently results in duplicative and wasteful spending annually because the software is not publicly shared. Agencies purchase closed source software (CSS) and services to customize as needed, leading to software purchasing and support that is costly, allows for little to no reuse, results in duplication of effort and spending across agencies, and overall yields poor quality (Mann, 2002; Rosenberg, 2007).

In August 2016, the White House issued the Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software (FSCP). 

The FSCP directed Chief Financial Officer's (CFO) Act agencies to do three things: 
1. Create an agency source code policy; 
2. Update acquisition language to capture new custom code; and, 
3. Create a source code inventory and publish at least 20% as open source software (OSS). 

The FSCP also established the Code.gov program and technical platform of a website and application programming interface (API).

## Purpose of the Study





This study examines whether and how organizational factors – cultural beliefs, public engagement, structural dimensions, and organizational location – affect agency policy implementation.

The study uses the publication of OSS as an indicator of effective policy implementation, and it identifies the factors that hinder or aid publishing OSS.


## Study Participants

Data was collected from GitHub’s application programming interface (API) and created a list of 23 of 24 executive-level agencies that published OSS both before and after the FSCP was issued. From these agencies, 25 participants from 20 agencies agreed to participate in the study.

The sample consisted of participants from units mostly located outside a Chief Information Officer (CIO) office that focused on software development and data science activities.


## Purpose of the Study

## Organizational Factors

## Reseach Approach

## Significance of the Study

The U.S. federal government has over 6,800 software projects listed on the Code.gov website with 80% being open source software (OSS) (“Sharing America’s Code,” n.d.). These software projects are reused at varying rates, resulting in software development efficiencies and cost savings to the user.

Commonly reused software project examples include GSA's [U.S. Web Design Standard](#), LLNL's [Zettabyte File System (ZFS)](#), EPA's [Water Network Tool for Resilience (WNTR)](#), and NSA's [WALKOFF](#).
