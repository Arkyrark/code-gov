# Overview of the Study
By Joseph Castle, PhD, Code.gov*

Computer software is essential for the daily operations of industry and government. “More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software – from movies to agriculture to national defense” (Andreessen, 2011, p. 1).

## Impetus for the Federal Source Code Policy (FSCP)

The federal government spends approximately six billion dollars on software each year (Johnson & Sears, 2017), representing 7% of the information technology (IT) budget of the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies (“Government-wide Information Technology Agency Summary,” 2017).

This purchasing of software frequently results in duplicative and wasteful spending annually because the software is not publicly shared. Agencies purchase closed source software (CSS) and services to customize as needed, leading to software purchasing and support that is costly, allows for little to no reuse, results in duplication of effort and spending across agencies, and overall yields poor quality (Mann, 2002; Rosenberg, 2007).

## The People's Code

Publicly funded software products are not open to the public even though the software is purchased with taxpayer dollars. The federal government has the responsibility to account for public spending, including IT spending. The publication of OSS is one way that the public can know about government spending, and OSS additionally benefits the public by providing access to code, thus, making it the “People’s Code.”



In August 2016, the White House issued the Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software (FSCP).




OSS is software that can be shared within a community of developers through accompanying licenses hosted in online code sharing platforms. The federal government has the responsibility to account for public spending, including spending for IT. The publication of OSS is one way the public can know about government spending. OSS additionally benefits the public by providing access to code, thus, making it the “People’s Code.”

This study examines whether and how organizational factors – cultural beliefs, public engagement, structural dimensions, and organizational location – affect agency policy implementation.

The study uses the publication of OSS as an indicator of effective policy implementation, and it identifies the factors that hinder or aid publishing OSS.


## Study Participants

Data was collected from GitHub’s application programming interface (API) and created a list of 23 of 24 executive-level agencies that published OSS both before and after the FSCP was issued. From these agencies, 25 participants from 20 agencies agreed to participate in the study.

The sample consisted of participants from units mostly located outside a Chief Information Officer (CIO) office that focused on software development and data science activities.


## Purpose of the Study

## Organizational Factors

## Reseach Approach

## Significance of the Study

The U.S. federal government has over 6,800 software projects listed on the Code.gov website with 80% being open source software (OSS) (“Sharing America’s Code,” n.d.). These software projects are reused at varying rates, resulting in software development efficiencies and cost savings to the user.

Commonly reused software project examples include GSA's [U.S. Web Design Standard](#), LLNL's [Zettabyte File System (ZFS)](#), EPA's [Water Network Tool for Resilience (WNTR)](#), and NSA's [WALKOFF](#).
