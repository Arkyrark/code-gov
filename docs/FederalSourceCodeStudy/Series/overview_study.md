# Overview of the Study
By Joseph Castle, PhD, Code.gov*

Publishing software and its associated source code for public use is a new phenomenon for U.S. federal government agencies.

In August 2016, the White House issued the Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software (FSCP).

## The People's Code

OSS is software that can be shared within a community of developers through accompanying licenses hosted in online code sharing platforms. The federal government has the responsibility to account for public spending, including spending for IT. The publication of OSS is one way the public can know about government spending. OSS additionally benefits the public by providing access to code, thus, making it the “People’s Code.”

This study examines whether and how organizational factors – cultural beliefs, public engagement, structural dimensions, and organizational location – affect agency policy implementation.

The study uses the publication of OSS as an indicator of effective policy implementation, and it identifies the factors that hinder or aid publishing OSS.


## Study Participants

Data was collected from GitHub’s application programming interface (API) and created a list of 23 of 24 executive-level agencies that published OSS both before and after the FSCP was issued. From these agencies, 25 participants from 20 agencies agreed to participate in the study.

The sample consisted of participants from units mostly located outside a Chief Information Officer (CIO) office that focused on software development and data science activities.
