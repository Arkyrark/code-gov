# History of OSS
By Joseph Castle, PhD, Code.gov <sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>

*This write-up elaborates on portions of the [Federal Source Code Study (FSCS)](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov/blob/master/docs/FederalSourceCodeStudy/FederalSourceCodeStudy.pdf), a three-year study conducted from 2017 to 2020 by the Code.gov team to better understand agency implementation of the Federal Source Code Policy (FSCP). The study considered open source software (OSS) publication as one indicator of FSCP implementation and examined why some agencies publish OSS and others do not.*

## Research on OSS

The history of OSS is intertwined with the broader history of hardware (HW) and software development (SW). <sup>[2](#fn2)</sup> <sup>[3](#fn3)</sup> <sup>[4](#fn4)</sup> <sup>[5](#fn5)</sup> A brief description of each phase of HW and SW development is provided.

- 1980s - 
- 1990s - 


Some of the earliest elements of OSS, community and code sharing, can be traced to Grace Hopperâ€™s work at the Harvard Computational Laboratory with her efforts in building a compiler for the Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL). <sup>[6](#fn6)</sup>
