## OMB update on FSCP
- Policy (M-16-21) continues - agencies have to create policy, update acquisition language to capture new custom code, and inventory code and post inventory on root directory.
- 20% pilot expired in August 2019 and working with OMB on ways to extend in the future. 
- IDC Update - OMB is no longer requiring agencies to complete the IDC report for M-16-21. Code.gov will work with agencies on metrics to monitor compliance.

## Updates to Code.gov platform
- Adding swing resources - 18F engineer, Code It Forward Fellow.
- Updating front-end to USWDS. About 80% finished.
- Various component and vulnerability updates.
