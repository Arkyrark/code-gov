2. Peter Meyer's email (Meyer.Peter@bls.gov) for those interested in participating in the Software Productivity and Quality Working Group.
3. As requested, here is the [agency liaison list](SupportingDocs/agency_liaisons.md). Please keep me (joseph.castle@gsa.gov) and Amin (amin.mehr@gsa.gov) updated on required changes (a PR works too!).

## OMB update on FSCP

    - Asking agencies to email OMB about new policy - Rebecca Williams (rebecca.a.williams@omb.eop.gov).
