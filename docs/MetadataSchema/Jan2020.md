# Metadata Meeting - 1/22/2020

## Three questions discussed

1. How does scraper deal with metadata when it aggregates json files?
2. How can agencies merge two or more code.json files?
3. Can Code.gov add additional metadata fields to the Metadata Schema 2.0?

## Discussion pertaining to question #1

- Each code repository contains a json file with metadata that shares the Metadata Schema 2.0 format.
- The json file has a consistent name and in root directory for discoverability by the scraper.
- Need more discussion about including metadata in the file but not in the 2.0 Schema. Including how to parse out private data. (Would you want this in the repo in the first place?)
- Ian began a [thread](https://github.com/LLNL/scraper/issues/45#issuecomment-577372871) in the Scraper repo on GitHub.

## Discussion pertaining to question #2

- Wrap agency code.json file into a list to allow for a component field.
- Have an organization field as a peer with agency to allow for multiple organizations/agency components in the same file.

## Discussion pertaining to question #3

- Change releases field in the Metadata Schema 2.0 to repositories.
- Allow measurementType to be optional and narrative.
- Allow laborHours to be optional. Possibly add cost to build, number of people, and value provided fields for additional clarity.
