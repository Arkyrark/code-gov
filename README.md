## What is Code.gov

[Code.gov](https://code.gov) is a website and program promoting good practices in code development, collaboration, and reuse across the U.S. Government. [Code.gov](https://code.gov) will provide tools and guidance to help agencies implement the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://code.gov/#/policy-guide/policy/introduction). It will include an inventory of the government's custom code to promote reuse between agencies and will provide tools to help government and the public collaborate on open source projects.

## Repositories

As a project, [Code.gov](https://code.gov) is a collection of repositories that enable the collection of source code inventory files. All of our work is open source and we encorage you to take a look and, if you wish, contribute to our projects by submitting a pull request, Github Issue, or commenting on existing issues and pull requests.

1. [GSA/code-gov-web](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-web): Our frontend project. Currently deployed as a static site, this project consumes a series of JSON files to display project repositories, client-side search index, and agency compliance dashboard.
2. [GSA/code-gov-api](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-api): Our backend API. An Express.js app backed by Elasticsearch. Its primary function is to index and make America's source code discoverable and searchable.
3. [GSA/code-gov-harvester](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-harvester): Our standalone source code inventory harvester. Currently this application generates the files needed by our frontend to display project repositories and our client-side search index. It also generates the data for the agency complaince dashboard.
4. [GSA/code-gov-developer-docs](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-developer-docs): Our developer docs! This repo is meant to be a simple way to start using our API and what you need to do so. It will also let our users get an API token.
5. [GSA/code-gov-style](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-style): Our effort to modularize our CSS styles.
