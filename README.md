# What is Code.gov?

[Code.gov](https://code.gov) is a website and program promoting good practices in code development, collaboration, and reuse across the U.S. Government. [Code.gov](https://code.gov) will provide tools and guidance to help agencies implement the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://code.gov/#/policy-guide/policy/introduction). It will include an inventory of the government's custom code to promote reuse between agencies and will provide tools to help government and the public collaborate on open source projects.

# Repositories

As a project, [Code.gov](https://code.gov) is a collection of repositories that enable the collection of source code inventory files. All of our work is open source and we encorage you to take a look and, if you wish, contribute to our projects by submitting a pull request, Github Issue, or commenting on existing issues and pull requests.

1. [code-gov-web](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-web): Our frontend project. Currently deployed as a static site, this project consumes a series of JSON files to display project repositories, client side search index, and agency compliance dashboard.
2. [code-gov-api](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-web): Our backend API. An Express.js app backed by Elasticsearch. It's primary function is to index and make America's source code discoverable and searchable.
3. [code-gov-harvester](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-harvester): Our standalone source code inventory harvester. Currently this application will generate the files needed by our front-end to display project repositories and our client side search index. It also generates the data for the agency complaince daashboard.

Each of our repositories follow our Code of Conduct and Contributing guidelines.
