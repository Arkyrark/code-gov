# What is Code.gov?

[Code.gov](https://code.gov) is a website and program promoting good practices in code development, collaboration, and reuse across the U.S. Government. [Code.gov](https://code.gov) will provide tools and guidance to help agencies implement the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://code.gov/#/policy-guide/policy/introduction). It will include an inventory of the government's custom code to promote reuse between agencies and will provide tools to help government and the public collaborate on open source projects.

To learn more about the project, check out this [blog post](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/08/08/peoples-code).

[Code.gov](https://code.gov) is an open source project, so we invite your contributions, be it in the form of code, design, or ideas.
