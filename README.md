# code-gov

Welcome! This repository is an information only project to act as a collection point for all Code.gov repositories.


## What is Code.gov

[Code.gov](https://code.gov) is a website and program promoting good practices in code development, collaboration, and reuse across the U.S. Federal Government. [Code.gov](https://code.gov) will provide tools and guidance to help federal agencies implement the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://code.gov/about/overview/introduction). It will include an inventory of the federal government's custom code to promote reuse between federal agencies. Also, [Code.gov](https://code.gov) will provide tools to help the government and the public collaborate on open source projects.
