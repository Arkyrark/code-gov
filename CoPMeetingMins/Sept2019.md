    - Have a calendar invite and will send out correspondence via Code.gov listserv
    - Forum to learn from each other, not about compliance but about realizing the benefits of engaging with public and releasing software
<br/>

* OMB update on FSCP: 20% and AI ML R&D metadata tags
    - Policy still exists - agency have to create policy, update acquisition language to capture new custom code, and inventory code and post inventory on root directory

<br/>

    - Metadata schema
        - Establishing a sub-working group - send email to Joe or Amin if you would like to participate
        - Ideas so far:
            - Date updated - mandatory field so we know when file was last updated
            - DHS - optional field: measurementType - allow users to specify a numeric value for  the optional field ‘method’ (example - method=linesOfCode, value=2573)
<br/>

    - https://defensesystems.com/articles/2019/09/10/dod-open-source-deasy-gao.aspx
    - Coming out with policy, may not publish 20% but figure out the appropriate amount

    - Defense Digital Service (DDS) working on open source more, have Code.mil
<br/>

* Current engagements: International CoP, SSA, FSCS, Harvard research on code valuation
    - International Community-of-Practice with Italian government and soon more EU governments 
    - FSCS - Federal Source Code Study - current research by Code.gov team focused on why some agencies publish code and others do not
    - Kicking off Harvard research on code valuation
        - What is the value of federal source code?
        - What is the dollar amount?
        - For each code base added, how much potential value (cost or efficiency) is provided to agencies?
        - Plan to establish workgroup around this and will be asking for volunteers for the study for data collection
<br/>
