**Code.gov Metadata Schema 2.0.0 Examples**

Code.gov developed this document to showcase good examples of metadata in current agency code.json files.  We hope it helps when creating your agency code.json file.  

Code.gov is the nationâ€™s catalog for U.S. Government source code.  The platform allows for discoverability of custom developed software that is reusable or open sourced.  The current metadata schema 2.0.0 allows agency inventory metadata to be displayed properly on Code.gov.

Benefits of having good metadata:
Allows for proper and accurate display of code inventory on Code.gov and agency websites.
Allows for code discoverability and sharing among agencies, industry, academia, and open source developers.
Increases probability of code contributions and collaboration from internal and external agency participants.
Increases engagement with the open source community, including multiple levels of government, corporations, open source foundations, academia, startups, technology leaders, and individuals (see diagram below).
